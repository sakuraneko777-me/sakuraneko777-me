## ⌈ about me ⌋

i build things quietly  
usually at night  
usually with too many tabs open  

i like:
⌈ terminals
⌈ dark ui
⌈ ai agents
⌈ systems that feel alive
⌈ shipping instead of talking

i don’t like:
⌈ bloated dashboards
⌈ loud designs
⌈ unnecessary abstractions

---

## ⌈ currently building ⌋

### ▸ mono os
a web-based operating system with an ai companion

- terminal-based ui
- live2d character
- voice + personality
- ai builder that exports real code
- token module pending

site:
mono-os.com

---

## ⌈ what i work with ⌋

frontend → react / next.js
ai → openai / anthropic / openrouter
voice → elevenlabs
character → live2d cubism
infra → vercel

i care more about **feel** than buzzwords.

---

## ⌈ philosophy ⌋

build in public
break things quietly
fix them at 3am
ship anyway

no hype  
no roadmap pressure  
just continuous iteration

---

## ⌈ future ⌋

- full-time vtuber + coder
- streaming builds
- ai companions as interfaces
- terminals as homes

slowly getting there.
